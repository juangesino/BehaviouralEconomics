# Behavioural Economics

In this repository, you will find all the files used for analysing the results of the experiment conducted during the course [Behavioural Economics](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2018-2019-en/search-course/course/58872) (6012B0265Y) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/home).


## Introduction

As part of an assignment for the course, we were instructed to perform a behavioural economics experiment for the class (using the rest of the students are subjects).

For our experiment, we recreated Nagel's (1995) experiment, but added a treatment group where participants were grouped in groups of three and participated as a single individual competing in a market with 5 other groups of 3. At the begining of the each round/stage we asked all the members of a group to log their individual response before discussing with the rest of the group about their final response.

## Data

The data contains the information for each subject that participated in the experiment. The data was pre-cleaned both during the experiment and at a later stage.

## Prerequisites

These files require Jupyter and Python 3.7, but the raw data can be analysed using any software of choice.
